## Usage
This simple dog quiz game can be easily played by clicking the "start-game" button. Once there, you will be prompted with a
question and four answers. If you get a correct answer, 50 points will be added to your score; there are no losses for answering 
incorrectly. While in-game, you have the option to start a timer to time how long it takes you to answer the questions. Further,
in the top-right, your progress throughout the quiz will be shown. Once completed, you can enter a username, and, if you chose,
a picture to store your score on the leaderboard! 

## Contributing
As this project serves as a formal final for my CPSC332 course, contributions are not being accepted to avoid academic integrity policy issues
